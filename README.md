# Clustering: A neural network approach
In [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089360800900207X), a comprehensive overview of 
competitive learning based clustering methods is given. Importance is attached to a number of competitive learning based clustering 
neural networks such as the self-organizing map (SOM), the learning vector quantization (LVQ), the neural gas, and the ART model.


# About this Project
In this project, two of the most famous NN-based clustering methods, SOM and LVQ, will be implemented. Their performance and efficacy,
will then be investigated through analysing different criteria such as 
[Calinski-Harabasz index](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/machine-learning-algorithms/9781785889622/8dba1062-2dbe-43ce-a9b0-9ea49203ea9a.xhtml), 
[Davies-Bouldin index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davies%E2%80%93Bouldin_index), and silhouette values as well as silhouette plot. 
The programming language for this project is chosen to be MATLAB and the dataset used is artificially created by sampling 
Gaussian distribution. Moreover, a linear dimensionality reduction based on 
[PCA (Principal Component Analysis)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) is performed as a pre-processing step. 


## Learning Outcomes:

* How to inspect and understand APIs and third party libraries to be used with Python 3

* How to apply the Python imaging library ([pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow)) to open, view, and manipulate images, including cropping, resizing, recoloring, and overlaying text

* How to apply the python tesseract ([py-tesseract](https://github.com/madmaze/pytesseract)) library with Python 3 in order to detect text in images through optical character recognition (OCR)

* How to apply the open source computer vision library ([opencv](https://github.com/opencv/opencv)) to detect faces in images, & how to crop and manipulate these faces into contact sheets
